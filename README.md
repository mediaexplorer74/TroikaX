# TroikaX (Transport card "Troika" data reader/fetcher) 

## Description
This repository is NFC App prototype (draft, sketch) made with Xamarin Forms tech specially for Android system. 
(the original source code was the Troika Dumper, the nativ Android application on Java). 
This app cannot write data, but reads some important parameters: the UID, balance of transport card, etc.
Please note: this is only technology prototype, my result of NFC-on-Android micro-RnD.
